Code of Conduct

Introduction
	CheckMate is a group that is made up of diverse, brilliant people and enthusiastic 
	programmers. Collaboration between group members and productive communication with the 
	tutor are critical factors for the teamwork. While Roehampton’s Students Code of Conduct 
	is providing the official framework for our group, our group’s Code of Conduct defines 
	the minimum requirements of professional behaviour we expect from each member of the group.

Our pledge
	We vow to act socially responsible and in an honourable manner. 
	All our procedures and activities must abide by all relevant international, national 
	and local laws and contractual terms.

Standards
 	All members of the group need to realize that behaving socially responsible and in
	an honourable manner is essential for our group’s identity and they are expected to conduct 
	themselves as respectful citizens of both the group/university and the local community.
	
	Examples of conduct that promotes a constructive environment:
	-	Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward group members
	-	Being respectful of differing opinions ,viewpoints and experiences
	-	Giving and accepting constructive feedback 
	-	Accepting responsibilities and apologizing to those affected by your mistakes/decisions

Enforcement
	We all depend on each other, so be patient and courteous. This is the only way we will 
	thrive as a team and produce the best product/app as a group. Your decisions will affect the 
	group, the clients, and the product. So before taking any decision, be considerate and think 
	about the others and the possible consequences of your decisions.
