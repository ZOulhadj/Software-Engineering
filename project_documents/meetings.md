## 14/02/22 – First meeting (1 Hour 25 minutes)
The first meeting was an introductory session for the group. During the meeting we discussed various topics such as the name for the group and getting 
to know eachother.
## 21/02/22 – Initial project requirements (2 hours 4 minutes)
Our main priority for this meeting was to ensure we were all on the same page regarding who oversees what and how the team will work together.
## 28/02/22 – Progress update (35 minutes)
The third meeting was quite a short one due to the extensive meeting that we had the previous week. Over the course of this meeting, we simply cross-checked 
with each other to ensure that we were on the right track. Furthermore, this gave us an opportunity to ask each other questions as well as to provide some help.
